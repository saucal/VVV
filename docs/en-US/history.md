VVV is a [10up](http://10up.com) creation and [transitioned](https://10up.com/blog/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/) to a community organization in 2014.

VVV has come a long way since it was first [launched as Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://jeremyfelt.com/code/2012/12/11/varying-vagrant-vagrants/) in December of 2012. Initially introduced as an exploration of workflow for immediate project needs at [10up](http://10up.com), VVV caught speed quickly as more and more of the team was introduced. During an internal [10up developer summit](https://10up.com/blog/10up-2013-developer-summit/) in March of 2013, Vagrant as a tool was a highlight and more developers made the conversion.

In April of 2013, we made a [call to the WordPress community](https://jeremyfelt.com/code/2013/04/08/hi-wordpress-meet-vagrant/) to try to encourage the addition of Vagrant to everyday life. These efforts continued with talks at [WordCamp Chicago](https://wordpress.tv/2013/12/31/jeremy-felt-hi-wordpress-meet-vagrant-2/), [WordCamp Vancouver](https://wordpress.tv/2013/10/19/jeremy-felt-hi-wordpress-meet-vagrant/), and WordCamp Denver.

In January of 2014, [10up](https://10up.com) made the decision to [spin VVV off](https://10up.com/blog/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/) into its own organization to better align with the community that has grown around the project over time. This transition opens doors for what [Varying Vagrant Vagrants, the organization](https://jeremyfelt.com/code/2014/01/27/varying-vagrant-vagrants-organization/) can accomplish as an ongoing project.
